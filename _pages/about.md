My name is Soo, a Ph.D. candidate in Strategic Management at the [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in the Republic of Korea. I am expected to graduate in May 2025.

My research lies at the intersection of sustainability, technological innovation, and strategy. In particular, I study how firms manage their technologies for a sustainable future, focusing on emissions, accelerated drug development to address global health challenges, and artificial intelligence.
